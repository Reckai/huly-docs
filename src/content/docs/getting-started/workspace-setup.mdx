### Creating your first workspace

When you first sign up for an account on Huly, you will be prompted to create a workspace.

Your workspace represents the virtual office space where your team will be working. Fully customizable to your team's unique needs, your workspace serves as a central hub for communication, project planning, task tracking and collaboration.

Give your workspace a great name and click `Create`.

### Inviting team members to your workspace

Once your workspace has been created, you can invite team members to join.

Select your profile icon on the bottom left of the sidebar. Then, select `Invite to workspace`. Select `Get invite link` to reveal the invite link. From there, you can copy the link, which you can share with your team members.

Under the current version of Huly, new members are not automatically added to projects and teamspaces unless you select the `auto join` toggle for those spaces. This helps you maintain control over who has access to the data within your workspace when new members join.

> ##### Configuring invite settings
> 
> Workspace invite links come with some default settings. To configure these settings, open the settings panel by clicking on the horizontal marks at the top left of the sidebar. Select `Invite settings` in the settings panel. Here, you can configure settings for your workspace invitations, including the duration the link will be valid for, email mask and limit.
