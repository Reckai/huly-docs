Our goal is to create documentation that covers all features, concepts and capabilities of the Huly platform. However, Huly Docs is still in development, and some features may not be covered. For further guidance, check out some of our other helpful resources below:

### Huly and TraceX YouTube Channels

We are constantly adding to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/@huly_io" target="_blank">Huly</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TraceX" target="_blank">TraceX</a> YouTube channels to include more feature demos and guided tutorials. This is a great place to start when looking for a quick overview of a key feature of the platform.

### Stay up to date on on X and LinkedIn

Feature previews and exciting changes are often shared first on our social media channels before they're even released! Following us on X (<a href="https://x.com/huly_io" target="_blank">Huly</a> and <a href="https://x.com/TraceXeQMS" target="_blank">TraceX</a>) and LinkedIn (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hardcoreeng" target="_blank">Huly</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tracex-company" target="_blank">TraceX</a>) is a great way to stay up to date, share feedback, and see what others are doing on the platform.

### Huly Community on Slack

For community support and questions about Huly or TraceX, the best place to reach out is through our Huly Community <a href="https://hulycommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-29kl7zmwz-2b3RRVTiWhhtAwzHjBm3Wg#/shared-invite/email" target="_blank">Slack</a>. 

Our Slack community includes a special `#tracex-qms` channel where you can get in touch directly with our team and meet other TraceX users.  

Our team is very active in the community and we always appreciate hearing feedback from our users. We hope our Slack community will bring Huly users together to learn, ask questions and share perspectives. We hope to see you there!
