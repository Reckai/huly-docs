Technical documentation is part of the Controlled Documents module and is used for managing product development records, such as test reports and requirement documents.

### Creating a technical document

To create a new technical document, open the settings menu next to any product space within the `TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION` submenu in the left sidebar and select `Create new document`.

> **Note:** A new technical document can also be created as a child of any existing document.

Proceed through the following steps to create the document:

* **Step 1:** Select a space (folder) and parent. A document can be the direct child of the space itself (at the top level of the space), or it can be a child of a document within that space.

* **Step 2:** Select a template for your document. See our guide on eQMS [templates](../templates) for more information about how to create reusable templates for controlled documents.

* **Step 3:** Provide details for your document, including a title, description, and reason for creation.

* **Step 4:** Select team members that will be working on the document, including Co-Authors, Reviewers, and Approvers.

After proceeding through the above steps, click `Create Draft`.
