Our goal is to create documentation that covers all features, concepts and capabilities of TraceX. However, Huly Docs is still in development, and some features may not be covered. For further guidance, check out some of our other helpful resources below:

### TraceX YouTube Channel

We are constantly adding to the <a href="hhttps://www.youtube.com/@TraceX" target="_blank">TraceX YouTube channel</a> to include more feature demos and guided tutorials. This is a great place to start when looking for a quick overview of a key feature of the platform.

### Stay up to date on LinkedIn

Make sure you don't miss important updates and announcements by following <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tracex-company" target="_blank">TraceX</a>. LinkedIn is a great platform to engage with content you want to see more of, share your feedback, and network with other TraceX users.

### Huly Community on Slack

For community support and questions, the best place to reach out is through our Huly Community <a href="https://hulycommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-29kl7zmwz-2b3RRVTiWhhtAwzHjBm3Wg#/shared-invite/email" target="_blank">Slack</a>. Our Slack community includes a special `#tracex-qms` channel where you can get in touch directly with CEO/Co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-rollet/" target="_blank">Charles Rollet</a> as well as meet other TraceX users. Our hope is for our Slack community to bring users together to learn, ask questions and share perspectives. We hope to see you there!
