Controlled documents are any kind of documents that are formally managed and maintained under a defined and regulated process to ensure integrity, accuracy, and availability throughout its lifecycle. These documents, used for version control, approvals and change management, will be reviewed by auditors.

There are 3 types of controlled documents in TraceX:

1. **[Templates](../templates):** Reusable document structures that can be used to create new documents quickly and consistently. Templates can be used for creating any other kind of controlled document.

2. **[Quality documents](../quality-documents):** Used for managing quality-related documents, such as standard operating procedures and work instructions.

3. **[Technical documentation](../technical-documentation):** Used for managing product development records, such as test reports and requirement documents.

Controlled documents are organized into spaces, each of which can have its own customized [roles and permissions](../roles). Spaces can contain any number of documents, and documents can be organized into folders within a space.

### Editing and formatting

While each type of controlled document is created through slightly different steps, all controlled documents have the same options available for editing and formatting.

Just like any other document in your workspace, you can use tags, attachments, images, tables, and other markdown formatting to customize your document.

The following options are available for further customization:

**Comments:** Highlight text and select the speech bubble icon. Comments can be viewed together in the right side panel, where they can be filtered and sorted.

**Sections:** Open the `...` menu beside the section title and choose to add a new section above or below.

**Descriptions:** Each section can have a short description that will help guide users on what to include in that section.

**Guidance:** Like the description, guidance provides further details on what should be included in a section. Guidance is used for longer descriptions, and can be hidden or displayed when clicking on the `i` icon beside the section title.

### Additional document settings

There are several settings available for controlled documents, found in the navigational tabs at the top of the document as well as in the right side panel. These settings are the same for all types of controlled documents, including templates, quality documents and technical documentation.

* **Reason & Impact:** Under the `Reason & Impact` tab, you can provide information on changes. This section is used to explain why the document was created or changed, and what impact it will have.The `Description` and `Reason` fields will be included in the `History` section of the document.

* **Team:** Under the `Team` tab, you can add or remove team members as Co-Authors, Reviewers, and Approvers.

* **Release details:** Under the `Release` tab, you can provide information on the release of the document, including the severity of the release (decimal change for minor updates; whole number change for major updates), and the effective date.

* **Trainings:** Also under the `Release` tab is the option to add a training.

* **History:** Under the `History` tab, you can view a log of changes made to the document, including the date and description of each change.

### Reviewing & approving

To send a document for review, click `Send for review` and select the members that will be reviewing the document. This menu will automatically populate with the reviewers selected when creating or editing the document, but you can add additional reviewers here as well. Then, click `Send`.

After the document has been reviewed, any further edits will be recorded for comparison. Selecting the `Comparing` option will allow you to view the edits to the document, using red and green highlights to show deletions and additions.

To send a document for approval, click `Send for approval` and select the members that will approve the document.

> **Note:** All comments need to be resolved before sending a document for approval. If unresolved comments remain, the `Send for approval` button will be disabled.

Once sent, the approvers can approve or reject the document.
