Templates are reusable document structures that can be used to create new documents quickly and consistently. In TraceX, you can create templates for Controlled Documents to ensure that your team follows the same format for each document type.

### Creating a template

Templates can be created either by opening the dropdown menu beside the `New document` button and selecting `New template`, or by clicking the `+ Template` button in the Templates section of the Controlled Documents module. 

Alternatively, a template can be created in a specific document space by opening the settings menu and selecting `Create new template`.

In the template creation dialog, you'll follow through the guided steps to create your template:

* **Step 1:** Select a space (folder) and parent. A template can be the direct child of the space itself (at the top level of the space), or it can be a child of a document within that space.

* **Step 2:** Provide details for your template, including a title, description and prefix, a category, and reason.

* **Step 3:** Select team members that will be working on documents using this template, including Co-Authors, Reviewers and Approvers.

After proceeding through the above steps, click `Create Draft`.

### Editing and formatting

Once your draft has been created, you'll be able to start editing your template content under the `Content` tab. 

Just like any other document in your workspace, you can use tags, attachments, images, tables, and other markdown formatting to customize your template.

The following options are available for further customization:

* **Comments:** Highlight text and select the speech bubble icon. Comments can be viewed together in the right side panel, where they can be filtered and sorted.
* **Sections:** Open the `...` menu beside the section title and choose to add a new section above or below.
* **Descriptions:** Each section can have a short description that will help guide users on what to include in that section.
* **Guidance:** Like the description, guidance provides further details on what should be included in a section. Guidance is used for longer descriptions, and can be hidden or displayed when clicking on the `i` icon beside the section title.

### Additional template settings

##### Reason & Impact

Under the `Reason & Impact` tab on your template, you can provide information on changes. This section is used to explain why the template was created or changed, and what impact it will have.

> **Note:** The `Description` and `Reason` fields will be included in the `History` section of the template.

##### Updating team members

Under the `Team` tab, you can add or remove team members as Co-Authors, Reviewers, and Approvers.

##### Release information

Under the `Release` tab, you can provide information on the release of the template, including the severity of the release (decimal change for minor updates; whole number change for major updates), and the effective date.

##### Adding a training

Also under the `Release` tab is the option to add a training. This will create a new training in the Trainings module that will be assigned to team members when they create a new document using this template.

##### Template History

Under the `History` tab, you can view a log of changes made to the template, including the date and description of each change.

##### Reviews and approvals

Use the right side panel to view the audit log of document reviews and approvals. 

### Reviewing & approving templates

To send a template for review, click `Send for review` and select the members that will be reviewing the template. This menu will automatically populate with the reviewers selected when creating or editing the template, but you can add additional reviewers here as well. Then, click `Send`.

After the template has been reviewed, any further edits will be recorded for comparison. Selecting the `Comparing` option will allow you to view the edits to the template, using red and green highlights to show deletions and additions.

To send a template for approval, click `Send for approval` and select the members that will approve the template.

> **Note:** All comments need to be resolved before sending a template for approval. If unresolved comments remain, the `Send for approval` button will be disabled.

Once sent, the approvers can approve or reject the template.
