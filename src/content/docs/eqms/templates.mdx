Templates are reusable document structures that can be used to create new documents quickly and consistently. In TraceX, you can create templates for controlled documents to ensure that your team follows the same format for each document type.

### Creating a template

Templates can be created either by opening the dropdown menu beside the `New document` button and selecting `New template`, or by clicking the `+ Template` button in the Templates section of the controlled documents module. 

Alternatively, a template can be created in a specific document space by opening the settings menu and selecting `Create new template`.

In the template creation dialog, you'll follow through the guided steps to create your template:

* **Step 1:** Select a space (folder) and parent. A template can be the direct child of the space itself (at the top level of the space), or it can be a child of a document within that space.

* **Step 2:** Provide details for your template, including a title, description and prefix, a category, and reason.

* **Step 3:** Select team members that will be working on documents using this template, including Co-Authors, Reviewers and Approvers.

After proceeding through the above steps, click `Create Draft`.
