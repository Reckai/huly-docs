Quality documents are a sub-section of the controlled documents module used for managing quality-related documents, such as standard operating procedures and work instructions.

### Creating a quality document

To create a quality document, open the settings menu next to `QUALITY DOCUMENTS` in the left sidebar and select `Create new document`.

> **Note:** A new document can also be created from the same menu on any document within the `QUALITY DOCUMENTS` section, which will create a direct child document.

Proceed through the following steps to create the document:

* **Step 1:** Select a space (folder) and parent. A document can be the direct child of the space itself (at the top level of the space), or it can be a child of a document within that space.

* **Step 2:** Select a template for your document. See our guide on eQMS [templates](../templates) for more information about how to create reusable templates for controlled documents.

* **Step 3:** Provide details for your document, including a title, description, and reason for document creation.

* **Step 4:** Select team members that will be working on the document, including Co-Authors, Reviewers, and Approvers.

After proceeding through the above steps, click `Create Draft`.
